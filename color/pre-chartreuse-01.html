        <p>Chartreuse (Yellow-green)</p>
        <p>Chartreuse is a color midway between yellow & green that was named due of its resemblance to the green color of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764.
        <p>Etymology
        <p>The French word chartreuse means "charter house". The monasteries that the monks of the Carthusian order (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764) live in, the first one of which was established in
            1082 by Saint Bruno, are called charter houses because they were chartered—and given generous material support—by the Duke of Burgundy known as Philip the Bold when he took over the area in 1378.
            Philip the Bold's elaborately decorated tomb was initially installed at a Carthusian charter house when he
            died in 1404.
